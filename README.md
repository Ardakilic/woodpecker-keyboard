# woodpecker-keyboard
5 row ortholinear keyboard, based on [Lumberelite](https://github.com/tjeffree/lumberelite) and [Lumberjack](https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard).

The fork is done in a way that a wireless controller such as [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) or clones could be utilized, and OLED module, Pimoroni Trackball or Cirque Trackpad could be applied over to the blank area.

All work on the PCB is done by [Özkan Çelik](https://github.com/ozkan), he made this due to my request.

Shields are done by Kazim Kaba and [Ender Piyale](https://github.com/enderpiyale/).

[The plates of Lumberjack Keyboard](https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard/tree/master/plates) work nicely. I'm currently using the `lumberjack-split` flavour on my board. Also the board is compatible with 60% cases. My case is a wooden one from a Chinese e-commerce website. I raised the micro controller with sockets to not to drill a hole to my case.
